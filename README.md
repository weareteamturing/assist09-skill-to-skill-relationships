# ASSIST09 skill-to-skill relationships

## Dataset
### Skills
[ASSIST09 skill builder dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/2009-2010-assistment-data/skill-builder-data-2009-2010?authuser=0) is compose of a total of 110 skills. In order to label the skill-to-skill relationships more accurately, math experts selected one of the categories of algebra, probability, statistic, and geometry for 110 skills.

**Description**
- `Index`: Index for separating skills and it is different from `skill_id` from ASSIST09 dataset
- `Skill name`: Name of skills
- `Category`: One of algebra, probability, statistic, and geometry


### Skill-to-skill relationships
There are five dataset files named `expert_1.csv`, `expert_2.csv`, `expert_3.csv`, `expert_4.csv`, and `expert_opinion_combined.csv`. Each of the four math experts independently labeled relationships of skills to reduce the bias against someoneâ€™s strong argument. After that, they discussed together until reach an agreement and selected related skill pairs using their common opinion.
